D-Bus Standard Library
======================
Implementations of the standard interfaces defined in the
D-Bus specification. This includes a full implementation of
the message-bus interface.

Notably, this does NOT include any clientside code (for
calling D-Bus methods). This should be implemented using
a binding generator or by calling manually.
