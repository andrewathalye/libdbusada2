libdbusada2
===========

A reimplementation of the reference D-Bus libary for Ada.

Why not D\_Bus/Ada?
----------------
The reference D-Bus library doesn’t support properties and its mechanisms for object registration and signals don’t mesh well with Ada constructs.

This rewrite isn’t based on the original code, but rather on the specification.
It aims to fully implement the D-Bus specification in Ada 2012 code.
